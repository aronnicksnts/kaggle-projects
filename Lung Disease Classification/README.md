# Abstract - Lung Disease Classification
Applying the CNN algorithm, the model was able to get an overall 95% accuracy in predicting the disease classification of the sample. It is recommended to have a more thorough research in checking whether the patient either has COPD or Pneumonia as the model seems to have had the most confusion on these two.
